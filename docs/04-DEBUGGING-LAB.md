These are deliberately proposed defects for a scratch branch. They are not claims that the shipped reference still contains these bugs. Keep main working and introduce only one change at a time.

## Case 1: Previewing already changes the shelf

**Introduce or discuss this mistake:** Push accepted rows into store.items inside previewImport.

**Discriminating experiment:** Preview a valid file without clicking Commit and inspect shelf length.

### Worked diagnosis

First state the expected contract: Import accepts a nonempty JSON array of rows with nonempty string IDs and titles, trims those fields, ignores extra fields, and rejects IDs already in the shelf or repeated within the candidate file. Preview reports accepted and rejected rows without changing the shelf. Commit is all-or-nothing and requires an unchanged source string and shelf version. A successful commit returns a new shelf; a stale or partially invalid preview cannot commit. Then create the smallest example from the experiment above. Compare the observed result with the contract before changing more code. The likely cause is at this boundary: **public/core.js: preview is a read-only transformation.**. Repair that boundary, rerun the example, and check one neighboring valid case so the repair does not merely special-case the chosen input.

The completed reasoning record is: symptom → contract violated → input that distinguishes hypotheses → owning line or rule → minimal repair → regression evidence. This is a worked diagnostic route; fill in your actual outputs when you run it. No invented console transcript is supplied.

## Case 2: Valid rows sneak through despite a rejected row

**Introduce or discuss this mistake:** Ignore canCommit and append accepted rows anyway.

**Discriminating experiment:** Use one valid title and one blank title.

### Your investigation

1. Write two possible explanations before looking at the hints.
2. Predict what the experiment would show if each explanation were true.
3. Run or inspect the smallest discriminating case and record the result.
4. Identify the owning file and make one bounded repair.
5. Verify the original case and a neighboring case; explain why both matter.

**Location hint, only after your attempt:** public/core.js: all-or-nothing check belongs in commitImport.

## Case 3: A stale approved proposal commits against new data

**Introduce or discuss this mistake:** Remove the version comparison.

**Discriminating experiment:** Preview, simulate shelf change, then commit.

5. Verify the original case and a neighboring case; explain why both matter.

**Location hint, only after your attempt:** public/core.js: source and version are approval preconditions.

## If the first repair does not work

Do not pile on another unrelated edit. Read the diff and check whether the observed failure changed. If the hypothesis was wrong, write that down and restore only your own experimental change before testing the next hypothesis. A rejected hypothesis is useful progress when its evidence is clear.

When asking an assistant for help, provide the exact input, expected and observed result, the current diff and the file you believe owns the rule. Ask for one counterexample or diagnostic question first. Keep proposed causes separate from demonstrated causes.
