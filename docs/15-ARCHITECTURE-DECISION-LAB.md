# M023: architecture decision laboratory

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

Architecture at this scale means assigning responsibilities and avoiding unnecessary synchronization. You do not need a distributed system diagram to make a consequential design choice. A small function boundary, a stable identifier or one CSS owner can determine whether a later change stays understandable.

## Decision review 1: Separate preview from mutation

**Reference rationale:** A preview is a proposed change that a person can inspect. The function returns data and never appends to the shelf. The explicit commit boundary makes it possible to prove that previewing twice has not imported twice. This also keeps parsing and ordinary validation errors away from the durable-looking shelf state.

**Question to resolve:** How would you detect a preview function that secretly mutated the shelf?

### Write competing proposals

Proposal A is the reference approach. Proposal B must be a plausible alternative, not an obviously broken straw man. Describe what each stores, what each derives, which boundary each validates and where visible feedback occurs. For a static page, describe source order, container/child ownership and content behavior instead of inventing application state.

### Use the same acceptance examples

Run both proposals against the same ordinary case, boundary and future-change scenario. If they produce different behavior, decide whether the difference is permitted by the contract. If both satisfy the contract, compare the number of facts a maintainer must keep synchronized and the amount of unrelated work needed for the next feature.

| Criterion | Reference proposal | Alternative proposal | Evidence needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meets current user contract | Fill in | Fill in | One discriminating example |
| Owns each fact in one place | Fill in | Fill in | Source or state diagram |
| Handles failure or missing input | Fill in | Fill in | Error/recovery sequence |
| Supports the next small story | Fill in | Fill in | Proposed bounded diff |

### Record the decision with a reversal condition

Write: “I choose A/B because this concrete example shows this cost. I would revisit the choice if this specific requirement appeared.” A reversal condition prevents the decision from becoming a slogan. Do not use a hypothetical million-user future to justify complexity that teaches nothing about the present example.

**Source anchor:** `public/core.js` and `public/app.js`. Inspect the actual dependency direction; a diagram that names layers but cannot identify a call or data flow is incomplete.

## Decision review 2: Choose all-or-nothing semantics

**Reference rationale:** Accepted rows are shown for diagnosis but none enter the shelf while any rejection exists. This avoids a beginner wondering which subset succeeded and whether retrying will duplicate it. Partial import is a reasonable alternative only with a different contract, retry policy and clearer per-row outcomes.

**Question to resolve:** What must a partial-import retry know that this implementation does not need?

## Decision review 3: Bind approval to source and version

**Reference rationale:** A preview is valid for one exact source string and one shelf version. Even a whitespace-only edit requires preview again, a deliberately conservative rule. The version check rejects a preview made against older shelf data. This is a local demonstration, not a multi-user transaction or server authorization mechanism.

**Question to resolve:** Why is disabling the button alone weaker than checking again inside commitImport?

## A compact decision record you can copy

## Avoid accidental scope expansion

A new abstraction should answer a problem you can name in the current code or selected story. If the main benefit is that it looks more professional, ask what specific change becomes easier and what new concepts a junior now has to learn. Keep the reference small enough to trace.

## Transfer the review habit

What observation proves that merely previewing a file did not mutate existing records?

Use that question to compare this project with its paired curriculum repository. Cite the actual source or guide you inspected; do not claim the other repository uses a pattern merely because its name sounds related. Your comparison may conclude that the shared learning concept appears in a different implementation.
